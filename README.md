## Projects

### Name Plate Assembly (Siemens NX)
- Created a multi-part parametric assembly using interpart expressions and constraints  
- Generated dimensioned 2D drawings from 3D models, including exploded views and part lists  
- Applied ANSI/ASME drawing standards learned in class

### Lab Manual #10: Parametric Modeling
- Designed a mechanical part using modeling tools like fillet, chamfer, shell, and draft  
- Produced 2D drawings from both a ‚Äúdumb solid‚Äù and a self-modeled part for comparison  
- Applied CAD standards for completeness and clarity

### Whimsical Design Challenge
- Designed and prototyped a basic phone protector using a pool noodle as the main material  
- Applied engineering design principles: constraints, iterations, and basic testing  
- Presented the design as part of a class challenge focused on creativity and low-cost solutions
