##  Key Projects

### Name Plate Assembly (NX CAD)
- Created a multi-part parametric assembly using Siemens NX, including a base, angle brackets, and nameplate.
- Built and constrained geometry using interpart expressions across models.
- Generated dimensioned 2D drawings using ASME Y14.5 standards, including exploded views and BOM.
- Developed understanding of modeling hierarchy, assemblies, constraints, and expression tables.

### Lab Manual 10: Parametric Modeling
- Modeled a machined part using fillet, chamfer, shell, and draft tools in NX.
- Practiced working from ‚Äúdumb solids‚Äù by reverse-engineering a STEP file and applying drawing templates.

### Whimsical Design Challenge (ENGG 019)
- Collaborated on a creative design challenge to build a low-cost phone protector using a pool noodle.
- Applied engineering design thinking under material constraints and conducted simple testing iterations.
